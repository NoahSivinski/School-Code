CSCI 2720 Project 5
Sorting Algorithms

I. Files:
-------------------
Sort.h			       Header file containing specifications for the
			       Insertion, Selection, Merge, Heap, and Quick
			       sort algorithms.

Sort.cpp		       Implementations for the Insertion, Selection,
			       Merge, Heap, and Quick sort algorithms.

SortDr.cpp	       	       Driver program testing the implemented sorting algorithms.

ordered.txt		       Input file containing integers put in ascending order
			       from 0 to 9999.

random.txt		       Input file containing the 10000 integers arranged randomly.

reverse.txt		       Input file containing integers put in reverse order 
			       from 9999 to 0.

report.txt		       Text file containing an analysis report of the program,
			       the results, and the sorting algorithms.

README			       Includes information regarding program.

makefile		       Compiles and links files while encoding dependencies
			       and commands needed to generate files.

II. How to Run main:
----------------------------
The executable "main" results from the compilation of the
Sort.cpp file to Sort.o and SortDr.cpp to SortDr.o.
Using a makefile, this program can be compiled and linked with:

      		       	  make
	                   OR
		      make compile

To run the built program "main", use the command:

       	                make run

To remove any old executable and object files before using the
make command, use:
     		       make clean

III. Team Member Contributions
-------------------------------------
N. Sivinski: Implemented Insertionsort, Selectionsort, and MergeSort algorithms, created header file, created driver file, created makefile, and assisted with Report.txt file.

C. Johnson II: Implemented Quicksort & Heapsort algorithms, created README.txt & Report.txt files, and assisted with general modifications to program.
