1. Checklist - I worked very hard on this project, at least 2x the amount of time I worked on the homeworks. I have attached three
files and my presentation, video, and report. I believe that this is all I need to state in my checklist but if not
please email me and I will respond immediately with whatever else is needed.
2. Report - Word count above 1200.
3. Presentation - Presentation is attached.
4. Video - Video demo is attached and is above the 3-minute minimum.
5. Code base - Code base is attached. The main engine is the MatchingEngine.py that can be tested using Test.py. The
OrderBookGUI creates a GUI for an Orderbook that uses the different algorithms. Please let me know if there is any confusion.
