 *
 * Purpose: A brief paragraph description of the
 * program. What does it do?
 * This program creates, displays, and graphs multiple values of 
 * x and y. Y is defined by the function y = 20.0 âˆ— |sin x|.
 * The user inputs the number of values, the minimum value of x,
 * and the amount to increment x. The program then finds the the 
 * corresponding y values. It then displays all the values and
 * graphs the function.
 *
