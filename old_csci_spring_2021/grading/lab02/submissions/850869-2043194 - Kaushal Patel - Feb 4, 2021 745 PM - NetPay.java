 * A brief paragraph description of the program. What does it do?
 * Purpose: The program below allows one to compute a personâ€™s 
 * gross and net pay based on their hourly wage, hours worked, 
 * and several withholdings. The program also counts in 
 * deductions to person's gross pay allowing them to get their 
 * net pay. These deductions will be federal tax, state tax,
 * social security, and medicare.
